<h2>AgricultureAI Docs</h2>
<p>This application was written in an ASP.NET server-client architecture. 
Server code, written in C#, contains startup and routing logic as well as persistence and machine learning functions. 
The client (written in HTML/CSS/Javascript) contains website and game logic.
If ever the client reaches back to the server (i.e. to get machine learning predictions or to store user data to the database), 
this is done through ajax requests and Razor page functions.</p>

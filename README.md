# AgricultureAI

The purpose of the AI Agriculture application is to educate farmers on how machine learning and AI can be useful to them. The application contains a central, 'pinnacle' Machine Learning (ML) model, trained from hundreds of plant images, with the capability of determining whether a plant is health or unhealthy.  The website of the application has 3 modules:

1. A learning module explaining AI and Machine Learning in Agriculture.
2. A game module where the user faces off against the AgricultureAI 'pinnacle' algorithm in identifying healthy/unhealthy plants.
3. A training module where users can create their own AI, give it a name, and 'train' it by voting on images and watch it progress/learn.  It's guesses as to what a healthy/unhealthy plant will be shown to create a feedback loop, so users can witness their AI become smarter.  Users can then save their AI and come back to it.

This application is written in ASP.NET.  For a developer, to locally launch and debug the application in Visual Studio, simply hit F5.
Eventually the application will be hosted and accessible to users on the web.  For a user, they can register or login, and visit/complete any of the 3 modules.
